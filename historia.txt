Kevin Story's

I was born in Honduras and raised from good parents. I'm studying web development hoping to work for an USA company.

In Honduras I've worked as a Customer Service Representative, looking for better opportunities I fell in the love with coding.

My parents helped me to choose this new path. I'm just happy for it!
